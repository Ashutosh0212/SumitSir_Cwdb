Out of this about 85% is carpet grade wool, 5% apparel grade and remaining 10% coarse grade wool which is underutilized. This 10% coarse grade wool is in the range of 32.5 microns and above in diameter. At present, wool industry provides employment in the organised wool sector to about 12 lakh persons, with an additional 20 lakh persons associated in the sheep rearing and farming.\r\nsector.\r\nThe coarse wool is not sought after because of its coarse diameter, presence of medullation, inferior quality of the product and difficulties during the processing. Though at the cottage level, certain amount of this wool is being spun into yarn by hand spinning, it suffers with many deficiencies in terms of yarn quality and heavy droppage of 50% - 60% on the original wool reducing the yarn yield to 40% - 50%.

In the building sector, sheep wool may have potential as it meets the requirements of green building components because it is an eco-friendly, renewable, and totally recyclable material. If used instead of common insulation materials (e.g., fiberglass, rock wool, polyurethane foam, polystyrene), sheep wool offers significant benefits for sustainability such as a reduction in the production costs for new insulating materials and in environmental pollution as it has less embodied energy than other materials.

In traditional herding societies like Changthang, nomads tend to move in regular patterns according to the seasons in order to find pasture land for the flocks which are their main source of livelihood. Grazing resources in a single location are limited and generally insufficient to support year-round habitation. Furthermore, local geography and climate of Changthang determines which pastures are available in which season. Movement of nomads typically goes between the winter dwellings in the lowlands near Indus river banks and vicinity of their villages and summer dwellings in mountain pastures. Circuits of nomadization may be confined to a relatively small area or may extend over long distances in many villages like Samad, Kharnak and Hanle. In conditions where vegetation is sparse, quite frequent movement may be necessary if the animals are not to starve.", "methodology_of_project": "Methodology and project implementation: 400 nomadic families will be brought under the ambit of the scheme.

The industry utilizes the raw material in the form of both natural and synthetic fibres. Natural fibres are used extensively in the textile market because of their natural and comfort feeling as well as a conscious environmental awareness among the consumers. These natural textile fibres come from three sources viz; plant origin (bast, coir, jute etc); mineral origin (asbestos fibres); and animal origin (wool, Pashmina, angora etc).\r\nThe fibre of animal origin grows from animal skin with the primary objective of protecting them from deleterious effects of heat and cold. Among all the animal fibres, wool is a predominant one (Karim, 2009) growing from sheep skin and is used in both the woolen and worsted sectors. Besides wool, the other group of natural fibres obtained from certain animals of goat, rabbit and camel families, rarer than more commonly used fibres and valued for some desirable properties is known as specialty hair fibres (Wani et al., 2010). The attributes and characteristics which give value to these fibres are smooth and glossy surface, their scarcity, rarity, pleasing hand, high price and their elegant and exclusive nature. Examples include Pashmina, angora, mohair, yak and camel hair.\r\nPashmina is one of the speciality hair fibres and is considered as a prince of speciality hair fibres. It is utilized for the development of aesthetic products like knitwear and woven fabrics. In India, majority of Pashmina is utilized for preparation of shawls in Kashmir valley which is mostly hand spun and hand woven. Processing of Pashmina is an age old practice in Kashmir valley and is known for its quality throughout the world. Traditional method of processing has given these Pashmina products a royal status (Yaqoob et al, 2012). The Geographical Indication Registry, Gol has also awarded GIS to Kashmiri Hand spun Handmade Pashmina Shawls under the name Kashmiri Pashmina. Pashmina industry in Kashmir is an export oriented industry worth millions of dollars. However, the absence of quality standards for Pashmina and Pashmina products has rendered this trade open to the exploitation by unscrupulous traders at the cost of genuine Pashmina products.\r\nDue to restricted availability and high prices, adulteration of Pashmina is becoming a common practice by unscrupulous manufacturers. Sheep wool is one of the cheaper substitutes for adulteration with specialty animal fiber, primarily because of its low cost and adequate availability and secondarily as surface properties and chemical composition of wool matches with other specialty fibers in one way or the other. Moreover, ultrafine/superfine merino wool of 14-16 \u03bcm and OPTIM of 15-16 \u03bcm developed by Australia is also available in the market for falsification of Pashmina fabrics. Such a problem, therefore, calls for a reliable test methods to differentiate cashmere from other animal fibers to confront adulteration.", "justification_of_project": "Pashmina is one of the speciality hair fibres, utilized for the development of woven products (shawls, stoles, mufflers etc.) in Kashmir valley adapting traditional tools and techniques which is mostly hand spun and hand woven. Pashmina industry is an export oriented industry worth millions of dollars catering to local, national and foreign customer base. However, the absence of quality standards for pashmina and pashmina products has rendered this trade open to the exploitation by some traders and manufactures at the cost of genuine Pashmina products. Due to restricted availability and high prices, adulteration of pashmina by cheaper and fine substitutes is becoming a common practice. Techniques have been laid down by the Bureau of Indian Standards for identification, labeling and marketing of pashmina products vide its notification No: BIS 17269:2019 with a purpose to avoid any discrepancies in the trade.\r\nFurthermore given to understand that the pashmina products are being seized by the customs and wildlife department with a apprehension that the pashmina products have an admixture shahtoosh creating agony to the exporters. The products are being tested by traditional light microscopic methods, which is not an authentic one. This has decreased the export of the pashmina products from 5000 crore to 1000 crores.
